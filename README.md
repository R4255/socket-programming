# socket-programming
this is the github repository to explain the client server connection , explaining each line of code with proper and sufficient explanation
You wont need to go to second place to understand socket programming
this repo contains the example of the hash sending and verification
#the client reads a file , calculate its hash 
#send both the files to server 
#the server recieves the file and the client hash 
#the server calculate the file hash 
#and then server matches both the hash 
#we will be using the sha256 to calculate the hash here

address family internet , it uses IPV4 to communicate
#sock stream ->it is reliable , stream oriented connection
